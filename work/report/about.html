<h1>About</h1>

<p>This website is part of the course websoft <a href="https://www.hkr.se/en/course/DA377B">Software Development for the Web</a>.</p>

<p>This About website is a short reflection on what this course is about and what we have done so far.
  <br>
  This course will cover many different programming languages. So far we have only covered git and some html. This website is created with the help of Git and cloning an already existing repository, where the teacher have some examples which we copy and then add our own comments or own content to already created website.</p>
