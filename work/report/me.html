  <p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself.</p>

  <p>My name is Johan Granberg, born and raised in Luleå, Norrbotten, the city is located far north from Kristianstad close to the finnish border. I moved from Luleå when I was about 20 years old, and have lived in London and Stockholms since then, I am now 32 years old.</p>

  <p>I have had many different jobs, most in retail and restaurant buisseness. But always been a bit of a hobby nerd, so software development felt like a good way to go </p>

  <p>I used to Snowboard alot when i was younger, however after an injury i could no longer Snowboard. Also I used to be more active with going to the gym but another injury is hindering me to be as active as I want to be</p>

  <p>Now I mostly play video games and hang out with friends.</p>

  <p>Hopefully i will update this during this course, because I am starting some rehab for my injury during this course</p>
