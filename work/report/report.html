                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
                                <p><b>Answer:</b> Before this session I knew somethings about git, github, nothing about markdown or github pages. I am not so experienced when it comes to major problems with merges, or how to solve these issues with reverting
                                    to previous versions. Hopefully this will not be a problem during this course. I have pushed pulled commit to and from git, mostly by using built in functions from IDE's, we have used Intellij. I like that this course
                                    forces the students to use git all through out the course and all the different sections.

                                    <p><b>Question 2:</b> Have you ever created websites before?
                                        <p><b>Answer:</b> I have never published a website or done one as work, but i did study web in highschool, where we learned how to create HTML websites.

                                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
                                                <p><b>Answer:</b> I have had a course in high school where we did some html coding. But most of my expereince comes from this program, during the Fundamental programming course I got my first hands on experience
                                                    of programming. Then we had the Android course which was the first time I have evere tried creating a mobile application. Nothing with JavaScript .NET or any other programming language this course will
                                                    cover.

                                                    <p><b>Question 4:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?
                                                        <p><b>Answer:</b> As stated above, I've had some experience writing html, but that was over 15 years ago, so my knowledge is not up to date and I cant really remember the syntax.

                                                            <p>
                                                                For this course section I would like to learn the basics of html syntax, and how to create webpages. Which I think so far it has giving me some insight. But I wish it would go a bit deeper, hopefully it will cover some more during the upcoming sections.
                                                                I am really looking forward to this course, because we will dabble a bit in many different programming languages, and try to do many things.
                                                                <p>
                                                                    For me who don't really know what I want to do when I finish this program this is a good opportunity to gain more experience and hopefully find something that I will love to work with in the future.

                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
                                <p><b>Answer:</b> I have some knowledge about html, as stated in S01 i did a html course back in highschool but that was over 15 years ago so i dont remember all the syntax and logic. I have no prior experience in CSS but
                                    Im really looking forward to learn the basics and i find it really interessting. I have seen some really cool exapmles of what you can do with CSS and hope i get to learn some cool ways of using CSS. Same with JavaScript
                                    i have no prior experience or knowledege but im looking forward to learn more about it.

                                    <p><b>Question 2:</b> Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</b>
                                        <p><b>Answer:</b> HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies such as CSS and JavaScript. CSS is used to control presentation, formatting and layout. JavaScript
                                            is used to control the behavior of different elements.

                                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
                                                <p><b>Answer:</b>Web browsers and servers communicate using TCP/IP. Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the standard application protocol on top of TCP/IP supporting web browser requests and server responses. Web
                                                    browsers also rely on DNS to work with URLs.

                                                    <p><b>Question 4:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?
                                                        <p><b>Answer:</b> I would like to learn most of the basics when it comes to how to design my website, what tools there are, and how to implement them. Especially CSS and Javascript, i am really looking
                                                            forward to learning about CSS. As stated above, I have seen some examples of what is possible to do with CSS, and it looks so good.
                                                            <p>
                                                                The same with JavaScript, i would like to learn most of the basics and how to implement these skills or tools in a good way. Clean coding, how to build my projects so it follows the latest standards. And how to for example run a JavaScript game thorugh
                                                                a website, or other interacting features which could depend on things like gravity.</p>

                            <h2>S03</h2>
                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I have no prior knowledge of client side JavaScript what so ever. But I found front-end to be more appealing then I originally thought. I found myselfe spending more time styling and messing around with CSS and
                                changed the movable task to a draggable object then coninueing with the harder parts of s03</p>

                            <p><b>Question 2:</b> Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> The only languages I have learnt is Java, so of course there are some similarities, but they also alot of diffirences. Like you dont have to specify that a var will be an array, it just does it.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I started early with changing the way the site was setup, and how i wanted the header to "stick" so that it followed when scrolling down. And how i wanted my footer to be alwys situated at the bottom of the page,
                                regardless what the size of the content was. When i started doing my duck, i found that i would rather have a draggable moving object then a clickable image. So after some googeling i found a good example of how to create
                                a draggable object that saves the position of where it was dropped. Took some configuration to have restrict the image to not leave the screen on the top and right, but still let it go down.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 4:</b>What is your TIL for this course section? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> To learn more about JavaScript client side and what you can do with it. It looks like there is so much you can do with JavaScript to make a page look, feel and behave the way "you" want it too. So far, no matter
                                what i have wanted to do, there is a way to do it with JavaScript, however finding out the exact way to do it is not so easy, especially for me as a beginner with JavaScript. And combining JavaScript with CSS to create
                                cool animations looks fun, but feels like its a steep learning curve. When fiddeling around with certain looks on buttons and animations i came across SCSS, which i really would like to learn the basics, and even more about.

                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I have no prior knowledge with either JavaScript, Node or npm. There where some similarities with Java and JavaScript. I dont know any programming tool equal to either npm or node.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Question 2:</b> How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I feel like JavaScript is more for me, because i would like to do more front-end stuff. I feel that Node.js is good to know beacuse it is popular in the workplace. Same with express, seems to be popular so itas
                                good to know. However i feel that i would prefer JavaScript then the other languages. </p>

                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I had no particular plan for this assignment, more than doing it. I thought it would be interesting learning about the different frameworks and the program runs as intended</p>

                            <p><b>Question 4:</b> What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
                            <p><b>Answer: </b>I didn't aim for a perticular grade, i did what i had time for before the next task started. But i aimed to pass the assignment atleast. From what i have heard the task 4 and 5 was challenging.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 5:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I learned a bit about JavaScript, and that i want to learn more about it. I don't have that much interest in backend, so i felt less interessted in Node and Express. But as mentioned earlier that Node and Express
                                is popular in the workplace, that it was worth learning something about it.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> How do you feel about PHP as a programming language? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I like they way you can split the HTML code and PHP. And how easy it is to reuse the for example header and footer. I've heard that PHP is not the most popular language right now. But i feel its still good to
                                go through the basics.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 2:</b> Can you compare PHP to other languages you know? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I cannot compare PHP to any other language i have learned so far. Some parts i can compare with fundamental programming languages like creating variables and such. A bit different way of using 'for each' and
                                other way of writing code, but not that much similar to Java.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I did not really have a plan for the assignment, I just followed the instructions. Of course i aimed for at least a 3, but i did what i had time for. If i have more time i will try and improve this assignment
                                for a higher grade. A lot of my time was spent on thesis work. </p>

                            <p><b>Question 4:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I learned some "vanilla" PHP, and that was good to know. Would like to learn some more, and i would really like to know what is the todays standard. For instance for me i have only my header part in header.php,
                                not the head part. I really would like to know if what i have done is within todays practice or not. </p>

                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I think it is hard for me to have the 'correct' opinion on what will be popular and what will stay popular. Beacuse of my limited knowledge of not only the different languages, but also how the market is progressing.
                                I would trust the more experienced practitioners, but when i have enough experience i can have a better input on the subject. </p>

                            <p><b>Question 2:</b> What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> As i am more interessted in the front-end part i think one of my choices will be JavaScript. Or other frameworks of JavaScript, such as React, Vue, TypeScript. I also think i would have to learn more CSS and
                                SCSS and how to make it work with JavaScript frameworks in a good way. </p>

                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> Did a search comparing React.js and Angular.js <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=%2Fm%2F012l1vxv,%2Fm%2F0j45p7w">"Link to source"</a>, and it shows that from 2016 and forward
                                React took over. At least when it comes to searches, and it looks like that trend is still going, Angular goes down and React goes up. I also did a search comparison between React.js and Vue.js <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=%2Fm%2F012l1vxv,%2Fg%2F11c0vmgx5d">"Link to source"</a>,
                                here you can see that React is still dominant, but Vue is slowly rising in popularity. So you can assume React is a framework would be good to learn.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 4:</b> If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> As i am more interessted in front-end i would try to pitch one of the more popular JavaScript frameworks such as React. And i would 'sell' it by showing its rising popularity and read up on it to show what can
                                be done with this framework and the suggested project. There must be a reason why its rising in popularity, so it sould not be that hard to find infromation on the subject. </p>

                            <p><b>Question 5:</b> What is your TIL for this course section? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> How the trend link works, and that React.js is the rising framwork compare to the others. Maybe it would be good to follow the trend of Vue and see if it becomes more popular.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology. </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> Hmm good question, there is some logic to the .NET platform, however kinda hard to get a good understanding of the logic. The video series .NET 101 had a good way of explaining how the logic for the webapp is
                                built, how the pages and models corelate to eachother.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Qustion 2:</b> Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course. </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> For me i think that .NET is in a way more complex when creating a website then normal HTML and JavaScript. For a smaller application i would not use .NET, but for a bigger project i can see the usefulness of
                                .NET. But in a way it is already structured in a way that you would want to structure a web project. Pages folder, Models folder, Layoutfile, HTML is already separate from the C# code, which is a nice way to structure the
                                application. In the beginning it was really confusing finding for instance the header part of the navbar, untill you wen in the Layout file. If maybe i woud have used visual studio, and not visual studio code, like they
                                do in the video series it would have made more sense. </p>

                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> As i found ASP.NET to be confusing and did not really like to "beautify" a console application i only aimed for a passing grade. I wish that i had more time with .NET to learn more about it, beacuse there are
                                alot of jobs that look for .NET developer. </p>

                            <p><b>Question 4:</b> What is your TIL for this course section? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I learned how .NET is structured, and how to create new projects with ASP.NET and how a basic website looks like. And how hard it is to find information on how to import a external library with visual studio
                                code. I found a really good library for creating dynamic tables for console applications, but i do not know how to import that library to visual studio. And i tried for a while to google a way on how to do it, and i did
                                not really find any answers. And when i asked my peers they only had one thing to say, good luck ! </p>

                            <h2>S08</h2>
                            <p>For this assignment, a set of tools should be used in order to evaluate the performance of a few websites. We are a group of 3, consisting of Ella Jensen, Johan Granberg and Rasmus Olsson.</p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12LX_dsJtw_f7RHTDO-FEdnFh1_lMa9TXuE_zeI9GH6M/edit?usp=sharing">Link to data sheet</a>

                                <p><b>1. Reddit</b></p>
                                <p>Reddit is a website I use everyday for a wide variety of reasons. I would describe it as a modern looking forum where you subscribe to a topic/genre eg. /r/soccer if i'm interested in soccer. I have always viewed the site
                                    to be a little slow but not at all problematic so measuring it to see if it actually is slow compared to real metrics could be interesting.</p>

                                <p>The measured performance turned out to be worse than I expected and some parts of the tests showed unreasonable results although that could be faulted by my understanding of the metric. Lighthouse and Pagespeed showed a
                                    similar general performance score of 20 and 26 but quite different results when it gets specific. Lighthouse showed a Time to interact of 28.8 seconds while Pagespeed showed a time of 11.1 seconds. None of the results
                                    feels representative of how it actually feels using the website. I would say it feels like 2-3 seconds when using it and i thought that was really slow so there might be some kind of issue when using these tools for
                                    this particular metric. Overall Pagespeed gave way faster results compared to Lighthouse yet gave it a similar general score.</p>

                                <p>Using the network tab i could see that it's a quite heavy site compared to the other 2 sites we analysed with up to 5 times the amount of resources received measured in MB. This is probably the result of the many images
                                    that are being loaded on reddit and this is probably also the reason the site takes 24.13 seconds to finish loading the page.</p>

                                <p>To speed up the page it's recommended to properly size the images which would lead to less data usage. It is also recommended to minimize main thread work but it's unclear on just how that would be done.</p>

                                <p>Web Performance will always be an important part of web development and it’s something to take seriously. Web pages today are expected to be fast these days and having a slow and unresponsive experience can have a serious
                                    impact on the user base.</p>

                                <b>2. Hltv</b>

                                <p>I chose the website www.hltv.org. The reason being since it's a website I often use, I would say daily. I’ve noticed it can be a bit slow sometimes and It could be interesting to evaluate the performance of a website I
                                    often visit.
                                </p>
                                <p>We could say that www.hltv.org could definitely improve their performance. However, it is a bit confusing since the PageSpeed Insights score is 98 whereas the Lighthouse speed is 35. I made sure that the tests were on desktop
                                    and I tested it in regular-mode and incognito-mode, still the same results. The speed index on Lighthouse was 6.8s whereas the speed index on PageSpeed Insights was 1.5s. It is a bit confusing since I don’t know which
                                    one is “correct”. Time to interact was also off. On PageSpeed Insights it was 1.7s and on Lighthouse it was 9.0s.
                                </p>
                                <p>Regarding the network tabs findings, the requests was 102 which compared to the other two websites, was the lowest. The resources were only 4.6 MB as well which, compared to the other websites, were the lowest.
                                </p>
                                <p>In order to load the page faster, they could properly size their images in order to save cellular data and this will improve the load time. They could also eliminate render-blocking resources.
                                </p>
                                <p>Web testing is important in order to check your webpage for potential bugs before its made live and is accessible to the public. When testing performance, you test the webpages response times at different connection speeds,
                                    stress test your website to determine its break point, test if a crash occurs due to peak load and also test the optimization for the browser and server side cache to reduce load times and compressions.
                                </p>
                                <b>3. Stronger</b>
                                <p>I decided to inspect the webpage www.stronger.se because a friend of mine is working with the design of that page.
                                </p>
                                <p>The overall Performance score was surprisingly low, only 14 when i did an inspection with Lighthouse and only 10 for the Pagespeed Insights check.
                                </p>
                                <p>But it received 72 in score for Accessibility, 83 in score for SEO and 79 in score for Best Practices for the Lighthouse audit. Because the other scores were so high, I was surprised the overall score was so low.
                                </p>
                                <p>There are more inconsistencies from these tests that confuses me, speed index for lighthouse was 7.8 and speed index from the Pagespeed Insight check was 11.4. It makes me question how accurate these “scores” are.
                                </p>
                                <p>However, the tips on how to improve the website so the “score” would be higher is interesting. I do question if it is actually needed. The website has a score of 79 for best practices. I would assume that there would be
                                    some improvement if the score was 100. But how much difference would it make? One of the improvement tips was to add an alternate text to buttons. As I am quite new to web development I don't know how much this would
                                    improve the website overall Performance score, but I don’t think it would matter that much.
                                </p>
                                <p>The tips that Lighthouse gives about images I understand and they sound like good advice. But I don’t know if it is applicable to this website, because I think they use the bigger file format to show their product in the
                                    best way.
                                </p>
                                <p>Web Performance especially for a website with an online store and with products such as fashion clothes, need to have a good looking website with good pictures but still be responsive and perform as good as possible. It
                                    may not look like this webpage would perform that good but to me it feels like it is quite responsive. I have not however tried ordering clothes and using the actual webshop.
                                </p>
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Question 2:</b> TIL</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> How i dont know if i can relay on lightoiuse or pagespeed insights. I dont know how good ther score, tips or tricks are. But it would be interesting to use these tools when creating the project, to see if it
                                actually helps.</p>

                            <h2>S09</h2>
                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten. </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I have had my identity stolen and someone bought goods from ebay in my name and shipped the wares to africa. So that could relate to Sensitive Data Exposure. There are ways for scammers to for example send a
                                webpage that looks like the original one or from the original webage. And if the user enters password or infromtaion, the scammers use this to purchase goods or steal money. This could relate to CSRF or Sensitive Data Exposure.
                                And if my google account was hacked, there are so much information that i dont really think about, the other day i recevied a notification from google maps which said see where you have walked and how much. This is information
                                i would not like anyone to have access to. This could relate to several topics of the OWASP but one could argue its related to Sensitive Data Exposure.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 2:</b> Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”. </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> Here are some guidelines to follow: </p>
                            <p>1. Encrypt important data</p>
                            <p>2. Be sure to use HTTPS and not HTTP</p>
                            <p>3. Test the application to see if there is something that you overlooked or does not function as intended</p>
                            <p>4. Be proactive, stay updated</p>
                            <p>5. Keep security simple, the more complexity and code it increases the likelyhood of bugs and vulnerabilities.</p>
                            <p>6. Detect intrusions, log everything</p>
                            <p>7. Do not trust third party code.</p>
                            <p>8. Authentification, Authorization. So that you try to controll what the users can do</p>

                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> What is your TIL for this course section? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> That thera are a lot of things to potentially think about when creating a website, depending on its usage there are more or less security issues to consider. And that OWASP existed, had never hear of it before

                        <section>
                            <h2>S10</h2>
                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> Write a general paragraph about how the project was implemented </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> We tried to do a betting website for esports, using Node.js, MySql, CSS, HTML and JavaScript. We chose to use MySql as database beacause we have worked with it in previosu courses, and Node.js as backend / server
                                side, and normal CSS and HTML for frontend. JavaScript was used on both server side and client side, and both on frontend and backend. </p>
                            <p>When starting the project we wanted to use the CSS Grids layout, because it is the latest within CSS techniques.</p>
                            <p>By dividing the page in different grid containers it was relativly easy to know how to style or implement what we wanted for each grid. We had some layout problems with how to style / manipulate the grids and its grid-items.</p>
                            <p>After some trail and error, we got the hang of it, the fun part with CSS and HTML is the ability to inspect each element via the browser and figure out how one can solve the problem, and try it directly in the browser.</p>
                            <p>It took some time figuring out how we wanted the site to function, and how to e.x. fill each container, and with what content. After looking at some of the existing betting sites we got some inspiration and then decided on
                                the way we wanted the site to be</p>
                            <p>Luckely we found an free open API from an esport site which made it easier to get information, rather then creating it and saving it in our own database. Such as different leagues, match dates, which teams were playing who
                                and so on.</p>
                            <p>The project or they way we wanted to do it was a bit too much for two people within the given time frame. And not all the parts of an actual betting site is implemented, like security for depositing and withdrawing of "real"
                                money from a card.</p>
                            <p>The overall style of the project was easy, more difficult, as previously stated, was how the site should function. </p>
                            <p>Some parts of the project took much longer then anticipated. For example, taping the video presentation took so much more time then we thought. </p>
                            <p>Our idea maybe was a bit too much for this course, not because of lack of knowledege, more on certain elements a real betting site has. Like security, handling money, odds setting and as none of us is a member of a betting
                                site we really did not have knowledge of how a user experience is like. </p>
                            <p>So our site ends up being more of a proof of concept then an actual fully functional betting site.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 2:</b> Finish with a final paragraph with your thoughts on the course and what you think about the material and the guide (about 5-10 sentences)</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> There was enough material in this course, dont really see the need to add more. If i would give any feedback about the material, it would be that some of the exapmle code was too good, but i understand why, we
                                learned so many new languages so it would take more time to learn all the necessary basics.</p>
                            <p>I feel that the lectures was good, filming the lectures is always a plus. I really liked that the whole course was on github, with a wiki for each assignement. And the basic how to for each assignment.</p>
                            <p>I really liked the course and the contents of it, however there where so many parts in it. 9 assignments a project and an exam, it is a bit too much espcially since we also during this period have our thesis.</p>
                            <p>For me it feels like the course took too much time from the thesis course, beacuse of all the parts that had to be done.</p>
                            <p>As a stand alone course i would recommend it to people who want to know several ways to do basic web development. We learned several for me, new languages like Node, NET, JavaScript and PHP. I would reate the course 7/10 </p>
