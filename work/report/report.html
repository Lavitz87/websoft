<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>1. Before this session I knew somethings about git, github, nothing about markdown or github pages.
<p>
2. I have pushed pulled commit to and from git, mostly by using built in functions from IDE's, we have used Intellij.
</p>
<p>
3. I have had a course in high school where we did some html coding.
Nothing with javascript or other coding.
</p>
<p>
4. As stated above, I've had some experience writing html, but that was over 15 years ago, so my knowledge is not up to date and
I cant really remember the syntax.
</p>
<p>5. For this course section I would like to learn the basics of html syntax, and how to create webpages.
 Which I think so far it has giving me some insight.
 But I wish it would go a bit deeper, hopefully it will cover some more during the upcoming sections.
</p>
I am really looking forward to this course, because we will dabble a bit in many different programming languages, and try to do
many things.
For me who don't really know what I want to do when I finish this program.

I have no prior experience in CSS but Im really looking forward to learn the basics and i find it really interessting. Same with JavaScript i have no prior experience or knowledege but im looking forward to learn more about it.
<p>
   2. HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies such as CSS and JavaScript.
   CSS is used to control presentation, formatting and layout.
   JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements.

   4. I would like to learn most of the basics when it comes to how to design my website, what tools there are, and how to implement them. Especially CSS and Javascript, i am really looking forward to learning about CSS. I have seen some examples of what is possible to do with CSS, and it looks soo good.
  <p>
    The same with JavaScript, i would like to learn most of the basics and how to implement these skills or tools in a good way. Clean coding, how to build my projects so it follows the latest standards.</p>
