1. Before this session I knew somethings about git, github, nothing about markdown or github pages.

2. I have pushed pulled commit to and from git, mostly by using built in functions from IDE's, we have used Intellij.

3. I have had a course in high school where we did some html coding.
Nothing with javascript or other coding.

4. As stated above, I've had some experience writing html, but that was over 15 years ago, so my knowledge is not up to date and
I cant really remember the syntax.

5. For this course section I would like to learn the basics of html syntax, and how to create webpages.
 Which I think so far it has giving me some insight.
 But I wish it would go a bit deeper, hopefully it will cover some more during the upcoming sections.

I am really looking forward to this course, because we will dabble a bit in many different programming languages, and try to do
many things.
For me who don't really know what I want to do when I finish this program.
