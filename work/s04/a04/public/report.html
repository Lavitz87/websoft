                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
                                <p><b>Answer:</b> Before this session I knew somethings about git, github, nothing about markdown or github pages. I am not so experienced when it comes to major problems with merges, or how to solve these issues with reverting
                                    to previous versions. Hopefully this will not be a problem during this course. I have pushed pulled commit to and from git, mostly by using built in functions from IDE's, we have used Intellij. I like that this course
                                    forces the students to use git all through out the course and all the different sections.

                                    <p><b>Question 2:</b> Have you ever created websites before?
                                        <p><b>Answer:</b> I have never published a website or done one as work, but i did study web in highschool, where we learned how to create HTML websites.

                                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
                                                <p><b>Answer:</b> I have had a course in high school where we did some html coding. But most of my expereince comes from this program, during the Fundamental programming course I got my first hands on experience
                                                    of programming. Then we had the Android course which was the first time I have evere tried creating a mobile application. Nothing with JavaScript .NET or any other programming language this course will
                                                    cover.

                                                    <p><b>Question 4:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?
                                                        <p><b>Answer:</b> As stated above, I've had some experience writing html, but that was over 15 years ago, so my knowledge is not up to date and I cant really remember the syntax.

                                                            <p>
                                                                For this course section I would like to learn the basics of html syntax, and how to create webpages. Which I think so far it has giving me some insight. But I wish it would go a bit deeper, hopefully it will cover some more during the upcoming sections.
                                                                I am really looking forward to this course, because we will dabble a bit in many different programming languages, and try to do many things.
                                                                <p>
                                                                    For me who don't really know what I want to do when I finish this program this is a good opportunity to gain more experience and hopefully find something that I will love to work with in the future.

                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
                                <p><b>Answer:</b> I have some knowledge about html, as stated in S01 i did a html course back in highschool but that was over 15 years ago so i dont remember all the syntax and logic. I have no prior experience in CSS but
                                    Im really looking forward to learn the basics and i find it really interessting. I have seen some really cool exapmles of what you can do with CSS and hope i get to learn some cool ways of using CSS. Same with JavaScript
                                    i have no prior experience or knowledege but im looking forward to learn more about it.

                                    <p><b>Question 2:</b> Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</b>
                                        <p><b>Answer:</b> HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies such as CSS and JavaScript. CSS is used to control presentation, formatting and layout. JavaScript
                                            is used to control the behavior of different elements.

                                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
                                                <p><b>Answer:</b>Web browsers and servers communicate using TCP/IP. Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the standard application protocol on top of TCP/IP supporting web browser requests and server responses. Web
                                                    browsers also rely on DNS to work with URLs.

                                                    <p><b>Question 4:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?
                                                        <p><b>Answer:</b> I would like to learn most of the basics when it comes to how to design my website, what tools there are, and how to implement them. Especially CSS and Javascript, i am really looking
                                                            forward to learning about CSS. As stated above, I have seen some examples of what is possible to do with CSS, and it looks so good.
                                                            <p>
                                                                The same with JavaScript, i would like to learn most of the basics and how to implement these skills or tools in a good way. Clean coding, how to build my projects so it follows the latest standards. And how to for example run a JavaScript game thorugh
                                                                a website, or other interacting features which could depend on things like gravity.</p>

                            <h2>S03</h2>
                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I have no prior knowledge of client side JavaScript what so ever. But I found front-end to be more appealing then I originally thought. I found myselfe spending more time styling and messing around with CSS and
                                changed the movable task to a draggable object then coninueing with the harder parts of s03</p>

                            <p><b>Question 2:</b> Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> The only languages I have learnt is Java, so of course there are some similarities, but they also alot of diffirences. Like you dont have to specify that a var will be an array, it just does it.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I started early with changing the way the site was setup, and how i wanted the header to "stick" so that it followed when scrolling down. And how i wanted my footer to be alwys situated at the bottom of the page,
                                regardless what the size of the content was. When i started doing my duck, i found that i would rather have a draggable moving object then a clickable image. So after some googeling i found a good example of how to create
                                a draggable object that saves the position of where it was dropped. Took some configuration to have restrict the image to not leave the screen on the top and right, but still let it go down.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 4:</b>What is your TIL for this course section? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> To learn more about JavaScript client side and what you can do with it. It looks like there is so much you can do with JavaScript to make a page look, feel and behave the way "you" want it too. So far, no matter
                                what i have wanted to do, there is a way to do it with JavaScript, however finding out the exact way to do it is not so easy, especially for me as a beginner with JavaScript. And combining JavaScript with CSS to create
                                cool animations looks fun, but feels like its a steep learning curve. When fiddeling around with certain looks on buttons and animations i came across SCSS, which i really would like to learn the basics, and even more about.

                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I have no prior knowledge with either JavaScript, Node or npm. There where some similarities with Java and JavaScript. I dont know any programming tool equal to either npm or node.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Question 2:</b> How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I feel like JavaScript is more for me, because i would like to do more front-end stuff. I feel that Node.js is good to know beacuse it is popular in the workplace. Same with express, seems to be popular so itas
                                good to know. However i feel that i would prefer JavaScript then the other languages. </p>

                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I had no particular plan for this assignment, more than doing it. I thought it would be interesting learning about the different frameworks and the program runs as intended</p>

                            <p><b>Question 4:</b> What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
                            <p><b>Answer: </b>I didn't aim for a perticular grade, i did what i had time for before the next task started. But i aimed to pass the assignment atleast. From what i have heard the task 4 and 5 was challenging.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 5:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I learned a bit about JavaScript, and that i want to learn more about it. I don't have that much interest in backend, so i felt less interessted in Node and Express. But as mentioned earlier that Node and Express
                                is popular in the workplace, that it was worth learning something about it.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 1:</b> How do you feel about PHP as a programming language? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I like they way you can split the HTML code and PHP. And how easy it is to reuse the for example header and footer. I've heard that PHP is not the most popular language right now. But i feel its still good to
                                go through the basics.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 2:</b> Can you compare PHP to other languages you know? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I cannot compare PHP to any other language i have learned so far. Some parts i can compare with fundamental programming languages like creating variables and such. A bit different way of using 'for each' and
                                other way of writing code, but not that much similar to Java.</p>

                            <p><b>Question 3:</b> Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result? </p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I did not really have a plan for the assignment, I just followed the instructions. Of course i aimed for at least a 3, but i did what i had time for. If i have more time i will try and improve this assignment
                                for a higher grade. A lot of my time was spent on thesis work. </p>

                            <p><b>Question 4:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                            <p><b>Answer:</b> I learned some "vanilla" PHP, and that was good to know. Would like to learn some more, and i would really like to know what is the todays standard. For instance for me i have only my header part in header.php,
                                not the head part. I really would like to know if what i have done is within todays practice or not. </p>
